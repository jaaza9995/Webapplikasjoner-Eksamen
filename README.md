## Jam – Interactive Story Game Builder ##

  The project Jam is a web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core, 
  allowing users to create, edit, and play interactive story-based games.

  Each game follows a linear, branch-and-merge structure, where players make choices that lead to different scenes in between the Questions, which in the end affects the Ending Scene. The goal is to make learning fun and interactive for kids, while keeping story creation simple for teachers.
